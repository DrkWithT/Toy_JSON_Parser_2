# Toy JSON Parser 2

This will be a toy JSON parser made in C++ with only the standard library. Also, this is my first project using GitHub Actions for automated building & testing.

### Required Tools
 - VSCode
 - Git
 - GitHub Actions
 - CMake 3.16+

### Notes
 - Only tested with an Ubuntu container, but locally developed on a MacBook.
